    <h1><b>Best Places to Visit in Sri Lanka</b></h1>
    <p>Sri Lanka is an amazing travel destination offering a wide range of places to visit. 
      This island, located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of India, presents visitors with 
      an incredible array of environments to enjoy and experience. </p>
    <p>Travelers can trace the island's fascinating history, from ancient times through the
      colonial period to the present, in cities like Colombo and Kandy. This relatively compact 
      island boasts eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites where that history is preserved.</p>
    <p>Incredible outdoor landscapes and safari experiences can be found in the country's large 
      elephant-filled national parks, like Yala and Udawalawe. Sri Lanka is also a beach-lover's 
      paradise, ringed by some of the world's most beautiful beaches.</p>
    <p>When planning a Sri Lankan adventure, keep in mind that the country experiences its 
       rainy season from May through August, making December through April usually the best
      time to visit. The shoulder season, September, October, and November, is a good time 
      to visit as well.</p>
